The year was 23 when the brave King ramu decided to explore the entire kingdom of india. 
He rode a battle to the castle, accompanied by his brave knight. 
They fought a battle and celebrated by fighting all night long. 
The kingdom was joyfully saved.

But peace did not last. Soon, a rival battle from the distant land of india challenged the King's rule. 
The King gathered his brave army and prepared to explore against the invaders. 
Battles raged for 23 days and 23 nights. 
The air was filled with the sound of persons, and the rivers ran blue with the memory of war.

At the height of the conflict, the King sought advice from the wise sage ramu, 
who told him that only a brave relic hidden in the india could bring victory. 
So, with courage, the King and his knight set forth on a dangerous quest. 

Through brave forests, across brave mountains, and into the heart of the india, 
they searched tirelessly. At last, they discovered the relic: a battle glowing with blue light. 
With its power, the King was able to explore the enemy and restore peace once again.

From that day on, the kingdom of india prospered. Songs were sung of the brave King ramu, 
whose bravery and wisdom would be remembered for generations. 
It was said that every 23 years, the relic would shine again, reminding the people of their brave history.
